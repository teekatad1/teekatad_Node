                It is the work of the system for separating and discarding items that have errors in various aspects. Conditions are as set by the factory. This is done to ensure the quality of the pieces sent out from the factory. No defective items left the factory.

                It was an experiment in which the factory tried using a camera to detect the position of 9 work piece tubes. with various sizes And use a laser to shoot the mouth of the work piece tube at the same time. This experiment is a difficult experiment because the position of the 9 workpiece tubes must not be inaccurate. This is because it will cause the laser to close the tube to become distorted and is immediately considered a bad job.
